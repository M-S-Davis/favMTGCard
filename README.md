## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets?

## Lessons Learned:

Express makes life _simplier_.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
